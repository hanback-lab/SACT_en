# Synchronous Counter

- **Synchronous Counter**

Problem with asynchronous counter or ripple counter is that the transmission delay of flip-flop accumulates, which means that not all states in flip-flops change simultaneously in synchronized with the input pulse.

This problem can be solved by using synchronous counter or parallel counter, in which all flip-flops are operated simultaneously by the input clock pulse. 

Since input pulses are applied to all flip-flops, another control method must be used to invert or maintain the current state by the clock pulse of each flip-flop.

The figure below is the logic circuit of 3-bit synchronous counter.

<br>

Circuit above is explained as below.

- CLK inputs of all flip-flops are connected together, so the clock is applied to each flip-flop simultaneously.

- The lowest bit is fixed to High only at J and K input terminals of Q0 flip-flop, and operates in the appropriate combination for another flip-flop.

- Synchronous counter uses more circuit element than asynchronous counter.

### **Design**

1. Prepare project file <a href="./pds/SYNC_CNT.zip" download>SYNC_CNT.zip</a> for the experiment. 
<br>

2. Move the project compressed file downloaded to d:＼work and unzip it.

3. Run Quartus II and select File > Open Project.

4. Go to d:＼work＼SYNC_CNT folder, where the files are unzipped, and open SYNC_CNT project.

5. Select File > Open to import SYNC_CNT.bdf file. Or double-click SYNC_CNT on the left side of the project.

6. Unfinished drawing is shown. Let's complete it with the drawing described before.

### **Compile**


8. Select File > Save and save, and select Processing > Start Compilation to compile.

    Compilation is process to verify that there are no errors in the designed logic circuit and create programming file and simulation file.


<br><br>


### **Simulation**

9. Select File > Open, and change File Type to All Files (.) in Open File window in the lower right corner, then select Waveform.vwf file.

10. In Waveform window, select Simulation > Run Functional Simulation to run it.

# Full Adder
---
## Theory

Full adder is a logic circuit that adds two input bits and carry input bit (Carry in: CIN) and outputs the sum and carry out (Carry Out: COUT).

It can be considered as adding carry input bit to the input of half adder.

The following table is the truth table of full adder.

Full Adder Truth Table      

|A|B|Cin||S|Cout|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|0|0|0||0|0|
|0|0|1||1|0|
|0|1|0||1|0|
|0|1|1||0|1|
|1|0|0||1|0|
|1|0|1||0|1|
|1|1|0||0|1|
|1|1|1||1|1|

<br>

Full adder can be implemented using a combination of XOR gate, AND gate and OR gate as below.

### Design

1. Prepare project file <a href="./pds/FA.zip" download>FA.zip</a> for the experiment. 
<br>

2. Move the project compressed file downloaded to d:\work and unzip it.

3. Run Quartus II and select File > Open Project.

<br>

4. Go to d:＼work＼FA folder, where the files are unzipped, and open FA project.

<br>

5. Select File > Open to import FA.bdf file. Or double-click FA on the left side of the project.

<br>

6. Unfinished drawing is shown. Let's complete it with the drawing described before.

<img src="./pds/fa03.png" alt="p01" style="width: 80%;"><br>

7. Double-click the drawing as shown below, or right-click the mouse and select Insert > Symbol.

<br>

8. Complete the circuit by importing “xor”, “or2" and “and2” symbol in the symbol window and connecting the symbols with wire.

<br>



### Compile

9. Select File > Save and save, and select Processing > Start Compilation to compile.

Compilation is process to verify that there are no errors in the designed logic circuit and create programming file and simulation file.

<br><br>

### Simulation

10. Select File > Open, and change File Type to All Files (.) in Open File window in the lower right corner, then select Waveform.vwf file.

11. In Waveform window, select Simulation > Run Functional Simulation to run it.

### Check Hardware Operation

12. Prepare SACT equipment. Connect USB cable and power cable and press the power switch to supply power to the device.

13. In Quartus software, select Tool > Programmer.

14. Check that USB Blaster is connected in Hardware Setup on Programmer window and press Start button to program, and check the operation of half adder on the device.

<br>

15. Operate the button switch and check the result through LED.

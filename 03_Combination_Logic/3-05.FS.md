# Full Subtractor
---
## Theory

Full subtractor calculates the difference (D) and the borrowed number (BO) from the subtraction of three input bits (A, B, BIN).

It means a circuit that can perform 3-bit subtraction including value borrowed from the upper digit.

<br>

The following table is the truth table of Full subtractor.

|A|B|BIN||D|BO|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|0|0|0||0|0|
|0|0|1||1|1|
|0|1|0||1|1|
|0|1|1||0|1|
|1|0|0||1|0|
|1|0|1||0|0|
|1|1|0||0|0|
|1|1|1||1|1|

<br>

Full subtractor can be implemented using a combination of XOR gate, AND gate, OR gate and NOT gate as below.

### Design

1. Prepare project file <a href="./pds/FS.zip" download>FS.zip</a> for the experiment.
<br>

2. Move the project compressed file downloaded to d:＼work and unzip it.

3. Run Quartus II and select File > Open Project.

<br>

4. Go to d:\work\FS folder, where the files are unzipped, and open FS project.

<br>

5. Select File > Open to import FS.bdf file. Or double-click FS on the left side of the project.

<br>

6. Unfinished drawing is shown. Let's complete it with the drawing described before.

<img src="./pds/fs03.png" alt="p01" style="width: 80%;"><br>

7. Double-click the drawing as shown below, or right-click the mouse and select Insert > Symbol.

<br>

8. Complete the circuit by importing “xor”, “and2", “or2” symbol in the symbol window and connecting them with wire.

<br>



### Compile

9. Select File > Save and save, and select Processing > Start Compilation to compile.

Compilation is process to verify that there are no errors in the designed logic circuit and create programming file and simulation file.

<br><br>


### Simulation

10. Select File > Open, and change File Type to All Files (.) in Open File window in the lower right corner, then select Waveform.vwf file.

<br>

11. In Waveform window, select Simulation > Run Functional Simulation to run it.

### Check Hardware Operation

12. Prepare SACT equipment. Connect USB cable and power cable and press the power switch to supply power to the device.

13. In Quartus software, select Tool > Programmer.

14. Check that USB Blaster is connected in Hardware Setup on Programmer window and press Start button to program, and check the operation of full subtractor on the device.

<br>

15. Operate the button switch and check the result through LED.

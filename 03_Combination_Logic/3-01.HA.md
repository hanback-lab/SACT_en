# Half Adder
---
## Theory 

Adder is a logic circuit that inputs two or more numbers and displays their sum as output.

Half adder is a logic circuit that adds two input bits (A, B) and produces sum (S) and carry over (C). The following shows the truth table of half adder.

<br>

Half Adder Truth Table

|A|B||S|C|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|0|0||0|0|
|0|1||1|0|
|1|0||1|0|
|1|1||0|1|

<br>

Half adder can be implemented using a combination of XOR gate and AND gate as below.

### Design

1. Prepare project file <a href="./pds/HA.zip" download>HA.zip</a>을 준비한다. 
<br>

2. Move the project compressed file downloaded to d:＼work and unzip it.

3. Run Quartus II and select File > Open Project.

4. Go to d:＼work＼HA folder, where the files are unzipped, and open HA project.

<br>

5. Select File > Open to import HA.bdf file. Or double-click HA on the left side of the project.

<br>

6. Unfinished drawing is shown. Let's complete it with the drawing described before.

<br>

<img src="./pds/ha03.png" alt="p01" style="width: 80%;"><br>

7. Double-click the drawing as shown below, or right-click the mouse and select Insert > Symbol.

<br>

8. Complete the circuit by importing “xor" and “and2” symbol in the symbol window and connecting the symbols with wire.

### Compile


9. Select File > Save and save, and select Processing > Start Compilation to compile.

Compilation is process to verify that there are no errors in the designed logic circuit and create programming file and simulation file.

<br><br>


### Simulation

10. Select File > Open, and change File Type to All Files (.) in Open File window in the lower right corner, then select Waveform.vwf file.

11. In Waveform window, select Simulation > Run Functional Simulation to run it.

### **Check Hardware Operation**

12. Prepare SACT equipment. Connect USB cable and power cable and press the power switch to supply power to the device.

13. In Quartus software, select Tool > Programmer.

14. Check that USB Blaster is connected in Hardware Setup on Programmer window and press Start button to program, and check the operation of half adder on the device.

<br>

15. Operate the button switch and check the result through LED.

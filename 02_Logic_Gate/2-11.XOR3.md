# 3 input XOR Gate
---
## Theory

XOR gate outputs 1 if the number of data lines where 1 is input is odd and outputs 0 if the number of data lines where 1 is input is even. 

That is, output is determined by the number of data lines where 1 is input regardless of the number of data input.

3-input XOR gate can be represented by symbol as below.

However, in the above case, since special IC must be used, 3-input XOR gate is implemented using 2-input XOR gate as shown below.

<br>

Operational truth table of 3-input AND circuit is as follows.

1 is output only when all three inputs are 1.

### Design

1. Prepare project file <a href="./pds/GATE_XOR3.zip" download>GATE_XOR3.zip</a> for the experiment.  
<br>

2. 다운로드된 프로젝트의 압축 파일을 d:\work 이동시킨 후, 압축을 푼다.

3. Quartus II를 실행키고, File> Open Project 메뉴를 선택한다. 

<img src="./pds/ex01.png" alt="ex01" style="width: 40%;"><br>

4. Go to d:＼work＼GATE_XOR3 folder, where the files are unzipped, and open GATE_XOR3 project.

<br>

5. Select File > Open to import GATE_XOR3.bdf file. Or double-click GATE_XOR3 on the left side of the project.

<br>

6. Unfinished drawing is shown. Let's complete it with the drawing described before.

<img src="./pds/xor303.png" alt="p01" style="width: 80%;"><br>

7. Double-click the drawing as shown below, or right-click the mouse and select Insert > Symbol.

<br>

8. Enter symbol name “xor” in the symbol window and click OK button.
Since this is 3-input XOR gate, design the circuit by importing two XOR symbols. For reference, the supported 3-input XOR gate symbol name is “xor3”.

<br>

9. Place 3-input XOR gate symbol on the drawing and connect it with wire to complete the circuit.

<br>

※ If the circuit is not connected correctly, it may not operate as planned.

### **Compile**


10. Select File > Save and save, and select Processing > Start Compilation to compile.

Compilation is process to verify that there are no errors in the designed logic circuit and create programming file and simulation file.


<br><br>


### **Simulation**

11. Select File > Open, and change File Type to All Files (.) in Open File window in the lower right corner, then select Waveform.vwf file.

12. In Waveform window, select Simulation > Run Functional Simulation to run it.

### **Check Hardware Operation**

13. Prepare SACT equipment.

14. Connect USB cable to USB B Type Connectxor3 at the top center of the device and to the PC.

15. Connect power cable to Power Connectxor3 on the left side of the device and press the power switch to supply power to the device.

16. In Quartus software, select Tool > Programmer.

17. Check that USB Blaster is connected in Hardware Setup on Programmer window and press Start button to program, and check the operation of 3-input XOR gate on the device.

<br>

18. Operate the button switch and check the result through LED.

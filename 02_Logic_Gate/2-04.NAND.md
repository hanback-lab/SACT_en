# NAND Gate
---
## Theory 

NAND operation is an operation in which the result of AND operation is output in reverse.

### Design

1. Prepare project file <a href="./pds/GATE_NAND.zip" download>GATE_NAND.zip</a> for the experiment.   
<br>

2. Move the project compressed file downloaded to d:\work and unzip it.

3. Run Quartus II and select File > Open Project.

4. Go to d:\work\GATE_NAND folder, where the files are unzipped, and open GATE_NAND project.

<img src="./pds/nand04.png" alt="p04" style="width: 70%;"><br>

5. Select File > Open to import GATE_NAND.bdf file. Or double-click GATE_NAND on the left side of the project.

<br>

6. Unfinished drawing is shown. Let's complete it with the drawing described before.

<img src="./pds/nand03.png" alt="p01" style="width: 80%;"><br>

7. Double-click the drawing as shown below, or right-click the mouse and select Insert > Symbol.

<br>

8. In the symbol window, enter symbol name “nand2” in ‘-Name-’ at bottom left, and click OK button.

9. Place NAND gate symbol on the drawing and connect the symbol with wire to complete the circuit.
<br>
※ If the wire in the circuit is not connected correctly, it may not operate properly.

### Compile


10. Select File > Save and save, and select Processing > Start Compilation to compile.

Compilation is process to verify that there are no errors in the designed logic circuit and create programming file and simulation file.

<br><br>

11. The image below shows that compilation has been completed.

<br>

### Simulation

12. Select File > Open, and change File Type to All Files (.) in Open File window in the lower right corner, then select Waveform.vwf file.

13. In Waveform window, select Simulation > Run Functional Simulation to run it.

<br>

### Check Hardware Operation

14. Prepare SACT equipment.

15. Connect USB cable to USB B Type Connector at the top center of the device and to the PC.

16. Connect power cable to Power Connector on the left side of the device and press the power switch to supply power to the device.

17. In Quartus software, select Tool > Programmer.

18. Check that USB Blaster is connected in Hardware Setup on Programmer window and press Start button to program, and check the operation of NAND gate on the device.

<br>

19. Operate the button switch and check the result through LED.

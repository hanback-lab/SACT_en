# SISO (Serial In Serial Out)

## Theory


Serial-input/Serial-output register is almost same as parallel-input/parallel- output register, except that data is stored one bit at a time.
Serial-in/serial-out register shifts one bit of data through the flip-flops to the other end of the register at each clock cycle.

As the clock continues to generate, data gets out of the register one bit at a time, in the order in which it was initially stored.

Below is a block diagram of 4-bit Serial-input/Serial-output register and is implemented as logic circuit.

Data input from DIN is output to output Q0 of the first flip-flop on the rising edge of the clock and connected to the input of the next flip-flop.
This data is output to the output Q1 of the second flip-flop on the next rising edge of the clock.

In the same way, data is transmitted in response to Rising Edge of the clock, and in the circuit above, after a total of 4 clocks generate, the data of DIN is output to Q.

CLRN signal initializes the values of all registers (flip-flops) to 0 when this value is 0.

The figure below shows the operation when arbitrary data and clock are applied to the 4-bit Serial-input/Serial-output register.

When CLRN has data of 0, all registers are initialized. When CLRN is 1 and clock is generated, the data entering the DIN is stored one by one in the internal register and outputted externally from the 4th clock.

In the waveform below, waveform of (Q0), (Q1), (Q2) are drawn together to show the operation within the logic circuit.
The actual output waveform for DIN input of 4-bit Serial-input/Serial-output register is Q.

It receives 4-bit data input and data input of D is output to Q only when it is the rising edge of the clock.
CLR is an input terminal to initialize data. When Low data is input, value of Q is initialized to 0000.

<br>


### **Design**

1. Prepare project file <a href="./pds/SISO_4BIT.zip" download>SISO_4BIT.zip</a> for the experiment.
<br>

2. Move the project compressed file downloaded to d:＼work and unzip it.

3. Run Quartus II and select File > Open Project.

4. Go to d:＼work＼SISO_4BIT folder, where the files are unzipped, and open SISO_4BIT project.

5. Select File > Open to import SISO_4BIT.bdf file. Or double-click SISO_4BIT on the left side of the project.

6. Unfinished drawing is shown. Let's complete it with the drawing described before.

<br>


### **Compile**


8. Select File > Save and save, and select Processing > Start Compilation to compile.

    Compilation is process to verify that there are no errors in the designed logic circuit and create programming file and simulation file.

<br><br>


### **Simulation**

9. Select File > Open, and change File Type to All Files (.) in Open File window in the lower right corner, then select Waveform.vwf file.

10. In Waveform window, select Simulation > Run Functional Simulation to run it.

### **Check Hardware Operation**

11. Prepare SACT equipment. Connect USB cable and power cable and press the power switch to supply power to the device.

12. In Quartus software, select Tool > Programmer.

13. Check that USB Blaster is connected in Hardware Setup on Programmer window. Press Start button to program to check the operation on the device.

14. Operate button switch, slide switch and check output result on LED.

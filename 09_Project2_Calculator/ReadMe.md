## Planning

In the previous Combination Logic, we practiced controlling adder and subtractor.

In this project, we will design a circuit that outputs the results of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division for 4-bit input data of A and B.

The equipment consists of 8 Slide Switches. Design a circuit that places A and B in S7-S4 and S3-S0, respectively, receives input and displays operation results of A and B on LED by button switch input.
